# Ergon

![Ergon](images/ergon.jpg)

*A forge-scarred hand on the bellows. The other holds a manifest. Every task enters raw. Every task leaves shaped.*

---

Ergon is a task orchestrator for AI coding agents. You give it a task description and it handles everything around the actual work: gathering context from past runs, spawning a worker session in tmux, tracing what happens, checking quality on the way out, and closing the loop. One command takes a task from "somebody should do this" to "done, here's the record." It's the part of the workshop that isn't the hammer — it's the bench, the vise, the logbook.

In Aristotle's ethics, every thing has an *ergon* — a function, the activity it exists to perform. The ergon of a knife is to cut. The ergon of an eye is to see. The ergon of a craftsman is to take raw material and return it finished. Not faster. Not louder. *Finished.*

The forge doesn't care about your intentions. It cares about what comes out the other side.

## Quick CLI

```bash
work run "add JWT authentication" --repo myproject
work spawn hugo --repo myproject     # spawn a ready worker session
work send agent-hugo "now fix the tests"  # inject a prompt into a running session
work run "fix flaky auth test" --repo myproject  # strict mode is on by default
work --strict=false run "fix flaky auth test" --repo myproject  # explicitly relax optional integrations
work context <bead-id>         # what should I know before starting this?
work status                    # what's active right now
work history                   # recent runs with outcomes
work trace <bead-id>           # replay a run's timeline
work feed --since 24h          # structured JSONL for learning-loop
work deliberate "should we split the auth module?" --type architecture
work decide "approve deploy?" --evidence pol-abc1,pol-abc2
```

## Configuration

### Runtime Profiles

Worker launch behavior is configured in JSON profiles, not hardcoded:

1. `$WORK_RUNTIME_CONFIG` (if set)
2. `~/.work/worker_profiles.json` (if present)
3. Built-in default profile

Profiles define runtime command + args, ready/trust detection patterns, model label, and optional agent-to-runtime mapping.

```json
{
  "default_runtime": "claude",
  "runtimes": {
    "<name>": {
      "command": "<binary>",
      "args": [],
      "model": "<model-id>",
      "ready_patterns": [],
      "trust_patterns": []
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "<agent>": { "runtime": "<runtime-name>" }
  }
}
```

The built-in default defines two runtimes:
- `codex`: runs `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, model `gpt-5.3-codex`
- `claude`: runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, model `claude-sonnet`

Both `work run` and `work spawn` resolve runtime from this profile chain. `--runtime` overrides only for that invocation.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WORK_STRICT` | Override strict mode: `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` enables, `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` relaxes |
| `WORK_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | Path to runtime profile JSON file (highest priority) |
| `LEARNING_LOOP_DIR` | Base directory for learning-loop scripts; falls back to `~/tools/learning-loop` |
| `HOME` | Used for all `~/.work` paths and fallback runtime config location |

### Failure Policy

Default mode is strict: optional integration errors become hard failures. Relaxed mode requires `--strict=false` or `WORK_STRICT=0`.

### Filesystem Layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `~/.work/` | Work root directory |
| `~/.work/traces/YYYY/MM/DD/trace-<bead>.jsonl` | JSONL trace files |
| `~/.work/index.db` | SQLite run index (auto-rebuilds from traces when empty) |
| `~/.work/citizens/<citizen>.md` | Per-citizen experience log |
| `~/.work/run-records/<bead>.json` | Run record files |
| `~/.work/feedback/<bead>.json` | Feedback collector output |
| `~/.work/senate-cases/senate-<bead>.json` | Senate deliberation case files |

## Dependencies

### Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tmux` | Worker session management and status |

### Optional (degrade gracefully)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `br` | Bead creation, search, and close |
| `gate` | Quality gate checks after worker completion |
| `relay` | Agent bus registration and result notifications |
| `bv` | Bead intelligence search, related, and plan |
| `loop` | Learning-loop query and run ingest |
| `senate` | Deliberation and handoff workflows (`work deliberate`) |

`git`, `bash`, and the runtime binaries configured in worker profiles (`codex`, `claude` by default) are also invoked during normal operation.

### Go Module Dependencies

- `github.com/spf13/cobra v1.10.2` — CLI framework
- `modernc.org/sqlite v1.46.1` — Pure-Go SQLite driver for run index
- `github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0`, `github.com/dustin/go-humanize v1.0.1` — Utilities

## Current Status

✅ Full run lifecycle: context gather, spawn, trace, gate, close
✅ Runtime profiles with fallback chain (env var, user config, built-in default)
✅ JSONL trace capture with SQLite index and auto-rebuild
✅ Strict mode for CI/production use
✅ `send` command for prompt injection into running sessions
✅ `deliberate` and `decide` governance flows
✅ `feed` export for learning-loop consumption
✅ Shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)

⚠️ `BrAgentState` calls (set agent working/idle state) are no-ops by design
⚠️ `deep` currently adds full `truthsayer` and `ubs` scans only. There is no separate risk gate until that check is real.
⚠️ Learning-loop template selection relies on an external `select-template.sh` script; skipped if absent
⚠️ SQLite index rebuild skips individually corrupted trace lines
